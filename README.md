#Recipes

I developed and/or modified these recipes while trying to eat lower sodium and lower sugar. Where "Salt" is called for, you can substitute nu-salt (sodium free salt). Where sugar is called for you can substitute splenda.

When I am cooking, I very rarely "measure" anything. Spices and sauces are usually "to taste". Sometimes I add more or less, or substitute.

I have many more recipes that are still floating around in my head or on 3x5 cards that people have given me.
