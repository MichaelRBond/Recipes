# Pizza

# Ingredients 

* 1 Batch Pizza DoughTomato Sauce
* 1 heaping table spoon Minced garlic (from jar with the oil works best)
* Olive Oil
* Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. 
* 50/50 shredded Blend of Low fat mozzarella cheese and provolone cheese
* 1 table spoon ricotta cheese (optional)

# Instructions

1. Roll out dough into large round sheet. 
    * About 1/16" to 1/8" yields a good thin crust pizza. Any thinner and it will end up with a soggy crust
1. For a "stuffed Crust" pizza, put shredded blend around edge and roll crust over top. 
    * You need to use a LOT more cheese than you think is necessary. 
	* You will have a lot of extra dough, cut it off before rolling. 
1. For a normal crust either leave flat or roll slightly (about double thickness of crust) to form edge
1. put one heaping table spoon of minced garlic in middle of crust. rub with hands to cover entire area where sauce will go.
1. lightly brush or rub olive oil to edge (where sauce and cheese do not go)
1. put in over for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.  
1. spread sauce over crust. 
1. Finely Chop or shred fresh mozzarella. 
1. mix 50/50 blend, Fresh mozzarella, and ricotta (optional)
1. spread cheese mixture evenly over pizza by "sprinkling" it



bake for another 10 minutes, or until crust is a golden brown and cheese is evenly melted. Do not let cheese brown.
