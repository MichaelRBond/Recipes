* 2 teaspoons of minced garlic

* 2 cans (29 ounces each) tomato puree
* 1 18oz can tomato paste
* 2 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
* 2.5 cups water
* 4 heaping table spoons dried Oregano
* 2 tablespoons dried basil
* 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
* 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

# Instructions

1. Saut√© peppers, Onions, and garlic in olive oil for about 5 minutes
1. add next 11 ingredients. Stir well. 
1. bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 2.5 hours. Stir often enough to make sure that nothing gets burnt over over cooked on the bottom. Every 15 to 20 minutes works well.
1. Let sit in pot on stove for 3 or 4 hours (longer is OK). 
1. Refrigerate in air tight container.  



Tastes best if you let it sit in the fridge for at least 24 hours. Makes enough for us to last about 3 to 4 weeks. Seems to keep well over that period of time in fridge.
