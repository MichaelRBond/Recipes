# Salsa

Please Note: This is still a work in progress. I haven't nailed down the exact amount of seasoning and spices yet, currently those are labeled as "To Taste" in the instruction section.

## Ingredients

1. 6 lbs of Tomatoes (Approx. 7 Tomatoes)
1. 2 Onions
1. 2 Green Peppers
1. Sugar, 1 Tbl for each tomato
1. Salt
1. Apple Cider Vinegar
1. 1 Package of frozen Yellow (or yellow/white mixed) Corn
1. Garlic
1. Cilantro
1. Hot Peppers*

## Tools

1. Food Processor - Use the Pulse setting for all chopping
1. large pot

## Instructions

Be sure to mix between each of these steps.

1. Cut tomatoes into large cubes and chop in food processor. The tomatoes should be 'chunky' when done, not "juiced".
1. chop onions and peppers in the same fashion. They should be chopped into small bits, not 'liquid'
1. Chop hot peppers, add
1. Add 1 to 2 cups of Apple Cider Vinegar
1. Add corn
1. Add sugar. I cut down on the acid from the tomatoes, i recommend 1 tablespoon per tomato used. If using Splenda as a sub, use 1/2 table spoon for each tomato
1. Add salt, to taste (approx 1.5 to 2 tea spoons.)
1. Add garlic, to taste (approx 3 to 5 table spoons)
1. Add Cilantro to taste (I lightly cover the top of the salsa, then mix in)

Bring to light boil, reduce heat medium low.

Reduce to approximately 1/2 volume. Takes about 2 to 3 hours.

Makes approx 4 pints of salsa.

Note: This salsa is best if you let it sit in the fridge for a day before eating. Also, the longer it sits, the less "spicey" it will become, as the flavors blend. What might be "Very Spicey" on the day it is made may only have a slight kick a week later.

### Hot Pepper Selection

Even mild salsa needs hot peppers for flavor. The type of hot pepper being used
is largely based on personal preference.

Mild:
For mild salsa I like to use 2 or 3 jalapeno peppers.

1 Trinidad Scorpion pepper.

Hot (normal):
2 Jalopeno peppers and 3 Habanero

Hot (New):
3 or 4 Trinidad Scorpion peppers
