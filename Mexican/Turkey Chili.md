# Turkey Chili

This is a WW Zero Point Chili. It can be adopted to be low sodium by substituting NuSalt for Salt.

## Ingredients

* 3lb 99% fat free ground turkey
* 2 green bell peppers
* 2 onions
* 2 jalapeno peppers
* 4 stem ripe tomatoes
* 2 cans low sodium, organic black beans
* 2 cans low sodium, organic kidney beans
* 1.5 cans of low sodium crushed tomatoes
* Franks redhot hot sauce
* Chili powder
* salt

Note: I use 2 jalepeno peppers to get *some* spice. But it will be a very mild chili. If you want a hotter chili use additional peppers or substitute with habanero or other hotter pepper. (Scorpion Peppers work well in this recipe)

## Tools

1. Slow cooker

## Instructions

1. Set slow cooker to high, to heat up while mixing
1. combine crushed tomatoes and ground turkey into slow cooker and mix well. This initial mixing helps ensure that the turkey is broken up properly
1. Chop to small/medium size green bell peppers, onions, and jalapeno peppers. Mix in well.
1. Drain cans of beans, and mix in.
1. Salt to taste. Personal preference, about 1/4 cup of salt.
  * Note: If using NuSalt, reduce the amount slightly since it has a saltier taste than Sodium Chloride
1. Chili powder to taste. Personal Prefernece, about 1/4 cup of powder.
1. Franks redhot to taste. Personal opinion, you can't use too much :)
1. Stir well
1. Chop tomatoes. Mix in.

Set Slow cooker to low heat for 8 hours. It is important to stir it occassional at the beginning so that it doesn't cook into a big meat ball thing, surrounded by liquid.

After 8 hours, check that the turkey is cooked through. If not cooked, set timer for another hour on low.

Taste. Ensure that spices are correct. Add salt, chili powder, and Hot Sauce to taste.

Let simmer on "warm" for another 2-3 hours.
